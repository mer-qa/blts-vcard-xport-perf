Performance test suite for vcard storage.

Uses Qt Contacts API to access vcard storage.

Note: A warning "Variant value is a QStringList but the property's value type
is neither CompoundType or ListType" is issued many times. This is most
probably due to missing property.setValueType() call in
QVersitContactExporterPrivate::encodeDisplayLabel()
